# Dinorun

Development framework accompanying the course [MCTA008-17 Computer Graphics](http://professor.ufabc.edu.br/~harlen.batagelo/cg/) at [UFABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/).

This is a prototype, not the actual game.

It's based on the dinorun game from google. Use the arrow keys to move the caracter and avoid the collisions with the rocks.
